Description: By the moment RKS ("rocks") provides four nice functions.
    The first computes the entropy of a given array and implement an 
    algoritm able to decompose it into between and within group entropy 
    (aka unrelated and related variety). The second calculates the 
    Coherence Index. The third and the fourth yield the ECI and the 
    Fitness/Complexity, respectively. In the future how knows?!
