Description: By the moment ReKS (``rex'') provides six main functions.
    The first computes the entropy of a given array and implement an 
    algoritm able to decompose it into between and within group entropy 
    (aka Unrelated and Related Variety, respectively). The second calculates 
    the Coherence Index. The third and the fourth yield the ECI and the 
    Fitness of a region, respectively. The last two provides two proximity
    measures between the different regional knowledge pieces. The other 
    functions provided help to plot the outcome of these last.
