\usage{
coherence(data, geo_dim, kng_dim, kng_nbr, time_dim = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{It is expected to be a data.frame in 'long' format.}

\item{geo_dim}{It is the name of the column of the data.frame that
represents its geographical dimension (e.g., the different regions of
analysis).}

\item{kng_dim}{It is the name of the column of the data.frame that
represents its knowledge dimension (e.g., the different patent classes of
analysis).}

\item{kng_nbr}{It is the name of the column of the data.frame that
represents the numerosity of each knowledge class (e.g., the number of
patents a region has in a given year in a given patent class).}

\item{time_dim}{It is the name of the column of the data.frame that
represents its temporal dimension (e.g., the different years of analysis).
It is an optional parameter}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the Coherence Index of each geographical area
in each time step of analysis.
