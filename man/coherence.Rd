\usage{
coherence(data, geo_dim, kng_dim, kng_nbr, null_model = NULL,
  names_as_strings = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{It is expected to be a dataframe in "long" format.}

\item{geo_dim}{It is the name of the column of the data.frame that
represents its geographical dimension (e.g., the different regions of
analysis).}

\item{kng_dim}{It is the name of the column of the data.frame that
represents its knowledge dimension (e.g., the different patent classes of
analysis).}

\item{kng_nbr}{It is the name of the column of the data.frame that
represents the numerosity of each knowledge class (e.g., the number of
patents a region has in a given year in a given patent class).}

\item{null_model}{It is useful to reuse this code in the coherence_panel
function, leave if NULL unless you have an object of class reks_null_model
that you whant to use as null model.}

\item{names_as_strings}{If TRUE the function assumes you have written the
name of the columns above said as strings, otherwise they are assumed to
be symbols. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the Coherence Index of each geographical area.
}
\description{
The function computes the so called Coherence index.
}
\details{
The function computes the so called Coherence index.
It assumes that the "universe" from which you derive the distribution of
reference is composed by all the information provided in the database, and
only this.
You can use it both on a panel data set (if you identify also a column with
a temporal indication of the observations) or on cross-section data (by
leaveing the parameter just said as NULL).
