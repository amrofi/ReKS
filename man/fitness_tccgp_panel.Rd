\title{Regional Knowledge Fitness Index a l√† Tacchella, Cristelli,
Caldarelli, Gabrielli and Pietronero, for panel data}
\usage{
fitness_tccgp_panel(data, geo_dim, kng_dim, kng_nbr, time_dim,
  binary_mode = "RTA")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{It is expected to be a dataframe in "long" format.}

\item{geo_dim}{It is the name of the column of the data.frame that
represents its geographical dimension (e.g., the different regions of
analysis).}

\item{kng_dim}{It is the name of the column of the data.frame that
represents its knowledge dimension (e.g., the different patent classes of
analysis).}

\item{kng_nbr}{It is the name of the column of the data.frame that
represents the numerosity of each knowledge class (e.g., the number of
patents a region has in a given year in a given patent class).}

\item{time_dim}{It is the name of the column of the data.frame that
represents its temporal dimension (e.g., the different years of analysis).
It is an optional parameter.}

\item{binary_mode}{It is "RTA" by default. The possible values are: "simple"
(if there is at least a patent in the geo. area in the particular tech. class
it is 1, and 0 otherwise); "RTA" or "RCA" (Balassa method);
"higher_quartiles" (similar to "simple", but it exludes the first quartile
(it seems the best choice, see below); "higher_quartiles_kng" (similar to
'higher_quartiles', but the quartiles are computed for each knowledge class,
assuming that some are more "ubiquitous" than others); "higher_deciles_kng"
(similar to 'higher_quartiles_kng', but it excludes the lower 10% rather than
the lower 25%). Warning: look carefully at the plot_biadj_matrix() output
because I personally observed that with RTA applied to patent data you do not
have the triangular structure observed in the trade data.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the Fitness Index of each geographical area
in each time step of analysis.
}
\description{
The function computes the Fitness (i.e. \emph{competitiveness}) of each given
geographical area considered, in each year provided (see the references
below for further details).
}
\examples{
RKFI <- fitness(data = df, time_dim = year, geo_dim = NUTS2,
kng_dim = IPC.3dig, kng_nbr = N.patents)
